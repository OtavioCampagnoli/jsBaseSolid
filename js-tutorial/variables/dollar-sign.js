/*
JavaScript Dollar Sign $

Since JavaScript treats a dollar sign as a letter, identifiers containing $ are valid variable names:
*/

let $ = "Hello World";
let $$$ = 2;
let $myMoney = 5;

console.log($);
console.log($$$);
console.log($myMoney);

/*

Using the dollar sign is not very common in JavaScript, but professional programmers often use it as an alias for the main function in a JavaScript library.

In the JavaScript library jQuery, for instance, the main function $ is used to select HTML elements. In jQuery $("p"); means "select all p elements".*/
