/*One Statement, Many Variables */

// You can declare many variables in one statement.

// Start the statement with let and separate the variables by comma:

let person = "Otavio Henrique", carName = "Fusca", price = 2000;

// A declaration can span multiple lines:
//Example:
let guess = "Henrique Otavio",
car = "Uno",
model = "Fiat",
value = 500;
