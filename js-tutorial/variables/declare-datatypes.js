// JavaScript Data Types

// JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe".

// In programming, text values are called text strings.

// JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings.

// Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.

// If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.
// Example
const pi = 3.14;
let person = "John Doe";
let answer = 'Yes I am!';

console.log(typeof(pi));
console.log(typeof(person));
console.log(typeof(answer));

// typeof() is a function to show what is the datatype, what you want to know.
