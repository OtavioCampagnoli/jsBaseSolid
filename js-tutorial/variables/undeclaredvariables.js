/*Variables are Containers for Storing Data

JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:

- Automatically;
- Using var
- Using let
- Using const

In thi first example, x, y and z are undeclared variables.

They area automatically declared when first used:
*/

x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;
console.log(z);

// Note: It is considered good programming practice to always declare variables before use.
