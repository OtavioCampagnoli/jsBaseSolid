// JavaScript Underscore (_)

// Since JavaScript treats underscore as a letter, identifiers containing _ are valid variable names:

let _lastName = "Campagnoli";
let _x = 2;
let _100 = 5;

console.log(_lastName);
console.log(_x);
console.log(_100);

// Using the underscore is not very common in JavaScript, but a convention among professional programmers is to use it as an alias for "private (hidden)" variables.
