// JavaScript Identifiers

// All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

// These unique names are called identifiers.

// Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

// The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

// Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
let name = "Otavio";
let complete_name = "Otavio Campagnoli";
let $name = "Otavio";
let n4me = "n4me";
// Names must begin with a letter.
// Names can also begin with $ and _ .
let _test = "test";
let $test = "another test";
// Names are case sensitive (x and X are different variables).
let x = "x";
let X = "X";
// Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.

console.log(name);
console.log(complete_name);
console.log($name);
console.log(n4me);
console.log(_test);
console.log($test);
console.log(x);
console.log(X);
