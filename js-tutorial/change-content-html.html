        One of many JavaScript HTML methods is getElementById().
        The example below "finds" an HTML element (with id="demo"), and changes the element content (innerHTML) to
        "Hello JavaScript":</p>

    <h2>Change content of html</h2>

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 'any thing content here.'; // after get element by id, I can change element content with .innerHTML attribute;
    </script>

</body>
