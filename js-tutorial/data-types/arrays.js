// JavaScript Arrays

// JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets [].

// Array items are separated by commas (,).

// The following code declares (creates) an array called cars, containing three items (car names):

const car = ["Fusca", "Honda Fit", "Ferrari"];
console.log(car);

// Array indexes are zero-based, which means the first item is [0], second is [1], and so on.

console.log(car[0]);
console.log(car[1]);
console.log(car[2]);
