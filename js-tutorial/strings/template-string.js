// Template Strings

// Templates were introduced with ES6 (JavaScript 2016).

// Templates are strings enclosed in backticks (`This is a template string`).

// Templates allow single and double quotes inside a string:

let text = `he's often called "Otavius".`;
console.log(text);

// Note:

// Templates are not supported in Internet Explorer.
