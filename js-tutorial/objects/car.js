// Real Life Objects, Properties, and Methods

// In real life, a car is an object.

// A car has properties like weight and color, and methods like start and stop:

// All cars have the same properties, but the property values differ from car to car.

// All cars have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times.

let oneCar = "Fiat";

// Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.

// example

const car = { type: "Fiat", model: "Uno", color: "White" };

console.log(car.type); // Fiat
console.log(car.model); // Uno
console.log(car.color); // White

// The values are written as name:value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).

// It is a common practice to declare objects with the const keyword.
